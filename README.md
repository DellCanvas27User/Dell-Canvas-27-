High-end Hardware under for Open-Source for Multimedia Creators Pipedream or is it?
Written by Jon Sandell


For the last couple of years, more and more professionals all around the globe have been looking for tools to help them create content for all kinds of media ranging from Graphic design, Video editing, 3D and Virtual-, Augmented Reality and all those other applications far and between. And most of the time they have been using just about anything that they could lay their hands on,
But...
Often it seems to be that most everyone has an opinion about what is the best or what is usable for their specific needs. This usually boils down to the choices and the awareness of what is possible.

For years Macintosh (Apple software & Hardware) was the preferred choice for creative people  and artists be it for professional Audio or Visual creation. This was catered by various hardware producers and vendors mostly in a limited availability options that exclude many with pockets that are not as deep as those who are working for big companies or who are fortunate enough to buy “the best of the best”. Since a couple of years ago, Windows has had their fair share of users turning to their products and the hardware that is supported by both Software and Hardware compatible companies that facilitate the industries that depend on their programs or Hardware.

¨Today we have access to highly advanced technologies. But our social and economic system has not kept up with our technological capabilities that could easily create a world of
abundance, free of servitude and debt ”.
Jacque Fresno 1916 - 2017

As illustrated by the above quote, the main reason we as a minority in a much larger group.
The group that gets most out of the loop are those artists that make use of Open Source software exclusively: people just like you and me who want software that does not impose on their wallet or their choice of how to use and with no forced payment scheme. But also software that enables one to create and be creative without sacrificing their integrity and creative ownership. The users of software Blender, Krita, Gimp, Mypaint often have to wait in the shadows while the software products like those by Adobe Autodesk Corel Medibang Sai etc. etc get the spotlight.

I guess what bothers me the most is that with all the innovation and the amazing community,  support for some things haven't really picked up. It is not uncommon that support and many others like me have chosen a different approach.

So after quite a bit of deliberation, I thought to make a small contribution for the people in the Open-source community who like to use their favorite software with high-end Hardware
